# Fraud Detection Project

This project leverages machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions with high precision. The project explores various anomaly detection models, comparing performance metrics such as detection accuracy, false-positive rates, and the practical implications of each approach.

## üìå Project Objectives
1. **Develop a Fraud Detection System**: Build a robust system capable of detecting fraudulent transactions effectively while minimizing disruptions from false positives.
2. **Compare Models**: Evaluate Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoder methods to identify the model that best balances accuracy with practicality.
3. **Optimize Detection Metrics**: Fine-tune models to achieve optimal fraud detection rates with fewer false alarms.

## üß† Skills Utilized
- **Machine Learning**: Applied algorithms like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM for anomaly detection.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned, preprocessed, and handled imbalanced data for improved model performance.
- **Python & Jupyter Notebooks**: Leveraged Python libraries (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow) and Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted accuracy, precision, and recall analysis to assess model performance.

## üîç Key Insights
- **Isolation Forest** and **One-Class SVM** demonstrated effective fraud detection, each capturing around 90% of fraudulent activities while maintaining a low false-positive rate. 
- The **Autoencoder model** showed higher fraud detection rates but generated many false positives, making it less suitable for scenarios requiring minimal disruption.
